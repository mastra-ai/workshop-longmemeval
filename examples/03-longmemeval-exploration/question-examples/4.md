❓ Question:
How much will I save by taking the train from the airport to my hotel instead of a taxi?

✅ Answer: $50

## Exploration

Even with topK 50, the agent isn't able to figure it out!

This is likely a reasoning problem where the LLM can't do math.

Load up the answer thread (search for answer_ in playground), asking the question directly to the agent in the thread with the answer still produces an incorrect result!

Memory can't solve everything. In this case the agent probably needs math and currency conversion tools to answer correctly.
